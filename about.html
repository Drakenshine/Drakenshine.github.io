			<p> My name is Tiffany Cole.  I am 30 years old who works at a full time job while attending Bellevue College part time (2 classes/quarter). </p>
<p>I've been in and out of college taking courses here and there since I graduated high school. however, I never got around to finishing an actual college degree.  I've been working at my current employer for 10 years and found that it's finally time to finish my bachelors degree - especially since I'd love to move into the IT department of the company I work for. </p> 
I'm working on finishing my Associates in Information Systems and Technology that focuses on Software Development here at Bellevue College.  Once I finish the Associates portion of the degree, I will be working on completing the BAS in Information Systems and Technology Application Development concentration (also here at Bellevue College).
<p>My end goal is to land a career that will utilize my degree and skills I learned.  Since starting school back up, I've learned C#, SQL and now am learning HTML/CSS/Javascript. </p>
